#ph-schematron

ph-schematron is a Java library that validates XML documents via [ISO Schematron](http://www.schematron.com).
It is licensed under Apache 2.0 license.

*ph-schematron* is the successor of *phloc-schematron* and all further development happens here. 

It offers several different possibilities to perform this task where each solution offers its own advantages and disadvantages that are outlined below in more detail. ph-schematron only supports ISO Schematron and no other Schematron version.
The most common way is to convert the source Schematron file to an XSLT script and apply this XSLT on the XML document to be validated. Alternatively ph-schematron offers a native implementation for the Schematron XPath binding which offers superior performance over the XSLT approach but has some other minor limitations.

Versions <= 2.9.2 are compatible with ph-commons < 6.0
Versions >= 3.0.0 are compatible with ph-commons >= 6.0

##News and noteworthy

  * 3.0.1 keep diagnostics in Pure version; resource resolving emits to error handler
  * 3.0.0 because of update to ph-commons 6.0.0; extended XSLT based API 
  * 2.9.2 because of update to ph-commons 5.6.0 
  * 2.9.1 fixes a classloader issue added in 2.9.0
  * 2.9.0 introduced new APIs in several places
  * Since version 2.8.3 there is an easy way to use XQuery functions (like funcx library)
    as custom XPath functions

## Usage with Maven
The dependency for ph-schematron looks like this:
```
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.helger</groupId>
  <artifactId>ph-schematron</artifactId>
  <version>3.0.1</version>

#ph-sch2xslt-maven-plugin

Maven plugin to convert Schematron (SCH) to XSLT at compile time using [ph-schematron](https://github.com/phax/ph-schematron) as the converter.

The conversion of Schematron to XSLT is quite costly. Thatâ€™s why this Maven plugin that does the conversion at build time. 

By default the plugin is run in the Maven lifecycle phase *generate-resources*. The basic configuration of the plugin in the `pom.xml` looks like this (inside the `<build>/<plugins>` element):
```xml
<plugin>
  <groupId>com.helger.maven</groupId>
  <artifactId>ph-sch2xslt-maven-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>3.0.1</version>
  <executions>
    <execution>
      <goals>
        <goal>convert</goal>
      </goals>
    </execution>
  </executions>
  <configuration>
    <schematronDirectory>${basedir}/src/main/schematron</schematronDirectory>
    <xsltDirectory>${basedir}/src/main/resources/xslt</xsltDirectory>
    <xsltExtension>.xsl</xsltExtension>
  </configuration>
</plugin>
```
The possible configuration parameters are:
  * `schematronDirectory` - The directory where the Schematron files reside. Defaults to `${basedir}/src/main/schematron`.
  * `schematronPattern` - A pattern for the Schematron files. Can contain Ant-style wildcards and double wildcards. All files that match the pattern will be converted. Files in the `schematronDirectory` and its subdirectories will be considered. Default is `**/*.sch`.
  * `xsltDirectory` - The directory where the XSLT files will be saved. Default is `${basedir}/src/main/xslt`.
  * `xsltExtension` - The file extension of the created XSLT files. Default is `.xslt`.
  * `overwriteWithoutQuestion` - Overwrite existing Schematron files without notice? If this is set to `false` than existing XSLT files are not overwritten. Default is `true`.
  * `phaseName` - Define the phase to be used for XSLT creation. By default the `defaultPhase` attribute of the Schematron file is used.
  * `languageCode` - Define the language code for the XSLT creation. Default is `null` which means English. Supported language codes are: cs, de, en, fr, nl.
